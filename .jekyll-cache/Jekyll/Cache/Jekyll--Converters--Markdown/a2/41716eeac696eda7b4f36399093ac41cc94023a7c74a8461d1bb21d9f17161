I"õ<p>As an international student from China, I started my journey to study at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It was my first time studying abroad and living independently at age of 18 years old. Through 7 years of up and down, I am finishing up my education with two degrees from UW-Madison, Bachelor of Science in Economics with a Mathematical Emphasis and Master of Science in Economics. I am grateful for the time that I have spent in Madison and I am ready to embrace what future brings me.</p>

<p>Through years of learning how to construct regression models and make forecastings, I gradually developed my interest towards data analytics. Since then, I have been focusing on building up my skillsets with Data Programming, Data Analysis, Economic Forecasting and Machine learning. These skill sets help me make the dive into the data world and make my attempt to analyze different interesting topics. I enjoy the process of preparing data, manipulating data and creating plots in order to discover trends and patterns or pose and answer question with data-driven insights.</p>

<p>I hope that I could become more mature as a Data Analyst with the help of developing this webiste and I am able to polish my skills along the way.</p>
