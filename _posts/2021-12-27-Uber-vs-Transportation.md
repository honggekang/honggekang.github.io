## In 2018, The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) reported that bus ridership in the city of Chicago decreased by 2.8% and rail ridership decreased by 1.9% compared to the previous year. 

## We seek to understand whether ridesharing services serve as a complement or a substitute to public transportation in Chicago and what environmental and social factors impact the effects using data from ridesharing rides in Chicago over the course of eight months and daily weather data.

 #### **Findings**

The model created using the data shows 
- A **positive significant** relationship between the number of daily ridesharing rides picked up near rail stations with the amount of daily riders on the CTA rail. 
- Ridesharing services can be serving as a **complement** to public ‘L’ ridership in Chicago. 
- On average, there is a **252877** passenger-increase in L rail ridership during weekdays and there is a **82288** passenger-decrease in L rail ridership during holidays and weekends.
