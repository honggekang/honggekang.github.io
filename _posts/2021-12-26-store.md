The report is based on a sample superstore dataset retrieved from the Internet and the main focus is to find what are some potential indicators that will affect this superstoreâ€™s sales performance. Correlation between these indicators will be shown in the report in order to find out the relationship between these economic values. 

<h3> Findings </h3>

From all the visualizations, it has shown that

- <strong class="covid">Product A</strong> is the best selling product among all three. All three types of products share similar pattern in sales perforamce over the year and these three are not substitutes. 
- <strong class="covid">Average holiday sales</strong> is higher than non holidays.
- CPI, fuel price and store size have a weak positive correlation with weekly sales. 
- Temperature has a positive correlation and Unemployment rate has a weak negative correlation.

<h3> Data </h3>
The original dataset contains more than 420,000 rows and has 17 columns which are store number, department number, date, weekly sales, is holiday, type, size, temperature, fuel price, CPI, unemployment, and 5 different markdowns.

The upper left bar graph is designed to display weekly average sales for different type of products. Due to some reasons, the dataset did not specify what specific type these products are. They are listed as type A, B and C. It seems like A is really popular throughout whole three years. The bar graph under it is showing how holiday is affecting sales. On average, there are more sales during the holiday which is not surprising. On the right is showing top 10 weekly sales by department number. Again, the dataset did not specify what are these department name instead it is showing by number. Therefore, I did not show the department number in the graph because it would not provide any useful information at all. 

At the bottom, a point graph is showing the monthly average sales number. It shows a clear seasonality in December in 2010 and 2011 and I think it is due to holiday season in December. In conclusion, from the first graph, it shows that holiday is affecting the sales for the store and December, specifically, is consistent to be the highest average monthly sales of all year. Moreover, the sales are increasing over the years. 


![trend](/img/posts/store/Trend Board.png "trend")

From the trend of weekly sales and unemployment number, I am able to see that both of the graph peaks at the same time in the same year period. I also create an action for hovering over each of the trend in order to observe other three indicators at the same time. The trend for fuel price and temperature is not as clear as unemployment number.

 The bottom area time series is trying to explore if different product will have distinct sales difference in different time or different season. However, the result shows that they share similar patterns during the same time period.

 A has the most sales comparing to the other two products; C, on the other hand, has the least of three all. The sales performance might indicate that A, B, C are not substitutes since they share the same selling patterns. 


![correlation](/img/posts/store/Correlation.png "correlation")

The matrix shows that temperature has the highest positive correlation with weekly sales and Unemployment has a weak negative correlation. Fuel price, CPI and store size all have a weak positive correlation. I believe the correlation could be stronger than what has shown here since I only take account the data for 2012. It would be more accurate if all historical data are included in the matrix. The table above the matrix has shown a table of store size and average weekly sales. It also verifies the positive correlation between store size and average weekly sales. As it is shown in the graph, the higher the store size number is, the more money the store is making.
