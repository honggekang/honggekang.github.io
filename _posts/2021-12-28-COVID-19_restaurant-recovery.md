#### U.S Restaurant industry of all could be affected by the pandemic the most due to the nature of the industry. It would be interesting to see how well the restaurant industry is recovering from Covid-19, more importantly, what is helping its recovery?


**Data**

Data of restaurant open for seated dinner is released by OpenTable. It is collected from restaurants of its own platform. The data is starting from Jan 28th, 2020 to  Oct 28th, 2021. Over 50 restaurants are recorded and the result is calculated into a percentage by comparing its year over year comparison. 

For example, of all restaurants that are recorded on OpenTable, the number of restaurants that are open for seated dinner on Jan 28th, 2019 is divided by the number of restaurants that are open for seated dinner on Jan 28th, 2020 and 2021. 0 % means that the same amount of restaurants are open on that day comparing to the same day in 2019. 

I have also collected daily test positive cases by states and daily vaccination from CDC. In order to match the time range for restaurant open data, the latter two datasets are also picked from Jan 28th, 2020 to Oct 28th, 2021. Population  for each state is also collected so that I could identify the relationship between test positive cases and population in the same states.


**Findings**

By comparing time series data of restaurant open for seated dinner, COVID-19 positive test cases and vaccination, I am
able to 
- Identify **crucial moments** when the recovery happens in different states.
- Discover that the U.S restaurant industry is **slowly recovering** from the pandemic, but the **impact of it is severe**. 
- **Vaccinations** greatly boost the confidence for owners to reopen but the policy of mask order during the pandemic does not seem to affect the industry significantly.

From the figure, between the top two line charts, the restaurant industry suffers a huge drop due to the start of the pandemic. Even though, the daily test positive cases does not show a dramatic increase, it does show that it is the start of the pandemic season. Then at the end of 2020, the restaurant industry is taking another hit while the whole country is experiencing its worst impact. Throughout the whole 2020, the trend of daily positive test cases is increasing and the trend of restaurants reopen is decreasing. There is no doubt that the whole industry is heavily damaged by the virus since the daily open percentage is never even close to what it was in 2019 at any given day in 2020. However, the trend changes in 2021 with help of vaccinations. By comparing all three line charts, the pandemic has another peak in September but the recovery of the industry is more stable comparing to last year. It could be the reason that more than half of people are vaccinated and are confident that the virus can be under control over the time.
