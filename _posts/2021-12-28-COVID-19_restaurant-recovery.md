#### U.S Restaurant industry of all could be affected by the pandemic the most due to the nature of the industry. It would be interesting to see how well the restaurant industry is recovering from Covid-19, more importantly, what is helping its recovery?


**Data**

Data of restaurant open for seated dinner is released by OpenTable. It is collected from restaurants of its own platform. The data is starting from Jan 28th, 2020 to  Oct 28th, 2021. Over 50 restaurants are recorded and the result is calculated into a percentage by comparing its year over year comparison. 

For example, of all restaurants that are recorded on OpenTable, the number of restaurants that are open for seated dinner on Jan 28th, 2019 is divided by the number of restaurants that are open for seated dinner on Jan 28th, 2020 and 2021. 0 % means that the same amount of restaurants are open on that day comparing to the same day in 2019. 

**Findings**

By comparing time series data of restaurant open for seated dinner, Covid-19 positive test cases and vaccination, I am
able to 
- identify **crucial moments** when the recovery happens in different states.
- discover that the restaurant industry in U.S. is **slowly recovering** from the pandemic, but the **impact of it is severe**. 
- **Vaccinations** greatly boost the confidence for owners to reopen but the policy of mask order during the pandemic does not seem to affect the industry significantly
