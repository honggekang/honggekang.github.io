Data of restaurant open for seated dinner is released by OpenTable. It is collected from restaurants of its own platform. The data is starting from Jan 28th, 2020 to  Oct 28th, 2021. Over 50 restaurants are recorded and the result is calculated into a percentage by comparing its year over year comparison.
