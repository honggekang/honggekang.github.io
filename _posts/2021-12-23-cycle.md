The data is collected from a bike rental company in Philadelphia and different factors like weather, seasons, day type and time difference are taken into account to uncover key drivers of demand variation for bike rental companies in order to help further improve their business development.

<h3> Findings </h3>

From the analysis of the dataset,
- Consistent registered users that support the bike rental business are crucial. And they are more active during the rush hour for the weekdays. More business strategy should devlope around them as they are the main target group of customers 
- Weather and seasons can affect both registered users and casual users. Spring is the least active season among all four.
- When it becomes more humidity, people may enjoy less of the weather and choose not to stay outside; however, windspeed does not affect customers behavior at all. 

<em>Weekend deals shoudl be developed to attract more causal users to rent the bike and increase the potential sale. Especially when the weather and season are both enjoyable.</em>
