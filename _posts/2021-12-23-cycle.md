The data is collected from a bike rental company in Philadelphia and different factors like weather, seasons, day type and time difference are taken into account to uncover key drivers of demand variation for bike rental companies in order to help further improve their business development.

<h3> Findings </h3>

From the analysis of the dataset,
- Consistent registered users that support the bike rental business are crucial. And they are more active during the rush hour for the weekdays. More business strategy should devlope around them as they are the main target group of customers 
- Weather and seasons can affect both registered users and casual users. Spring is the least active season among all four.
- When it becomes more humidity, people may enjoy less of the weather and choose not to stay outside; however, windspeed does not affect customers behavior at all. 

**Weekend deals should be developed to attract more causal users to rent the bike and increase the potential sale. Especially when the weather and season are both enjoyable.**


<h3> Data </h3>

The pie chart displays the proportion of casual users and registered users of all users. As it is shown in the chart, 82% of all the users are registered users and only 18% of all the users are unregistered users. It is clear that the rental service is commonly among registered users.

The column chart shows the monthly total bike rentals for 2011 and 2012. It shows that for all the months, bike rentalâ€™s total is higher in 2012 and it could be the development of the company. And in 2011, June has the highest total bike rentals and in 2012, August has the highest total bike rentals. Furthermore, in 2011,  February has the lowest total of bike rentals and in 2012, January has the lowest total of bike rentals. It is not surprising since the general weather gets worse, less people tend to ride a bike.

The line chart shows that the number of average bike rentals by all users, registered users and casual users in different day of weeks, from Monday to Sunday. In general, the average of all bike rental users is stable throughout the whole week. The registered users decrease during the weekends and casual users increase during the weekend. A main group of customers can be assumed to be people who needs short distance transportation for work. Terrible rush hour may force them to use public transportation combining with rental bikes. As for casual users, their rental activities can be considered to be more random. These people could be tourists who would enjoy riding bikes to explore the city. 

![weekday](/img/posts/store/Store Performance.png "weekday")
![weekend](/img/posts/store/Store Performance.png "weekend")

The two line charts show the comparison between registered users and casual users for weekends and weekdays. As for weekdays , the average rental bike users are stable but low. And registered users are high during 7-9 am and 18-19 pm. As we concluded in the last section, registered users possibly use more during rush hours. And during weekends, both registered and casual users have the peak at around 12-14pm. People may take this time to explore the city since the temperature is the highest around this time.

A linear regression model is constructed  and it shows that 33.44 percent of the number of bike rentals by all users is expressed by this regression function. And in those variables, mist, spring, fall, year, temperature and windspeed all have a positive correlation with the dependent variable, all users. And the rest of the independent variables, humidity, Precipitation, and summer have a negative correlation with the numebr of bike users.
