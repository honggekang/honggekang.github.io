 College completion rate is tied to multiple factors and it is related more to my own since I am in my last academic year for master degree studying. I will inspect gender, family income, race, tuition fee and SAT,ACT score as if they would affect college completion rate.

<h3> Findings </h3>

 The linear regression model shows that 
 - **Tuition fee** is postively correlated with college completion rate.
 - **SAT/ACT score** is postively correlated with college completion rate. 
 - **Alien** of all race categories has the highest college completion rate.

 <h3> Data  </h3>

 I am able to retrieve the data from College Scorecard University/College level data about school and its student cohorts and I mainly focus on the latest dataset which is from 2016 to 2017.

There is a huge difference between different states and the range is from 0 to 700. **California** contains the most numbers of institutions in the whole country. However, it is hard to compare the difference between the majority of the states. The distribution of institutions are not even, **majority of the states** only have less than or about 200 institutions. **6 states** have more than 300 institutions. And among them, state of California has around 700.
