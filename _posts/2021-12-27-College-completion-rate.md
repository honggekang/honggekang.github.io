## College completion rate is tied to multiple factors and it is related more to my own since I am in my last academic year for master degree studying. I will inspect gender, family income, race, tuition fee and SAT,ACT score as if they would affect college completion rate.

 <br/><br/>

 ### Findings

 The linear regression model shows that 
 - **Tuition fee** is postively correlated with college completion rate.
 - **SAT/ACT score** is postively correlated with college completion rate. 
 - **Alien** of all race category has the highest college completion rate.

 ## Data

 I am able to retrieve the data from College Scorecard University/College level data about school and its student cohorts and I mainly focus on the latest dataset which is from 2016 to 2017.
